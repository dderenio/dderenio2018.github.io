    <a href="#top-page" id="top-btn"></a>


    <section class="case-cnt-right foo">
      <p>When beginning the redesign of the Capital Markets website, our team constructed an outline of the necessary UX practices which we felt were the most necessary for a successful redesign. The practices that were defined in this meeting included:</p>

      <ul class="list-point">
        <li>Content Inventory</li>
        <li>Review of Site Analytics</li>
        <li>Card Sorting Priortization with the LOB (Line of Business)</li>
        <li>Competitive Analysis</li>
        <li>Site Mapping</li>
        <li>Wireframing</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Content Inventory</h3>

      <p>To begin the redesign process, and ensure that our team was focusing on the correct sections, we had to develop a deep understanding for the current Capital Markets website to understand the pain points and sections that required the most work. </p>
      <p>As the only intern on the team, I was tasked with doing a complete content inventory of the current website on an excel document outlining key information such as:</p>

      <ul class="list-point list-point-alt">
        <li>URL Link</li>
        <li>Level/Depth of Page</li>
        <li>Page Name</li>
        <li>Content Summary</li>
        <li>Personal Comments</li>
      </ul>

    </section>
  </div>

  <section class="img-wrap img-margin foo">
    <img class="case-img" src="img/BMO/BMO-Content-Inventory.png">
  </section>

  <div class="wrapper case-section">
    <section class="case-cnt-right-extra foo">
      <p>With the help of our site crawler, I was able to review over
        <b>1,100 unique pages</b> within the Capital Markets section, many of which were not even accessible. By the time our redesign was complete, we were able to
        <b>reduce the total number of pages by 94%</b>, with only 50 pages for the entire Capital Markets website.</p>

      <h3 class="case-subsection">Site Analytics</h3>
      <p>After analyzing the results of the content inventory, we were then able to compare them with the data we received from the analytics team. Doing so allowed us to develop an understanding of the most important pages not only to the line of business, but to the actual individuals using our website.</p>

      <div class="bmo-site-analytics foo">
        <h4> Capital Markets: Visits By Page </h4>
        <h4> January - May 2015 </h4>

          <img class="analytics-graph" src="img/BMO/BMO-Site-Analytics-Pie-Graph.png">

          <ul class="analytics-data">
            <li>
              <span class="legend legend-1"></span>Miscellaneous: 68%</li>

            <li>
              <span class="legend legend-2"></span>Home Page: 17%</li>

            <li>
              <span class="legend legend-3"></span>Products - Treasury: 5%</li>

            <li>
              <span class="legend legend-4"></span>Careers: 3%</li>

            <li>
              <span class="legend legend-5"></span>Products: 3%</li>

            <li>
              <span class="legend legend-6"></span>About: 3%</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
      </div>

      <h3>Card Sorting - Content Priortization</h3>
      <p>While the site analytics provided us with an understanding of the most visted pages, according to users, we now had to compare these results to what sections were viewed as the most important according to the line of business.</p>
      <p>In order to develop this empathy and understanding, we sat down with key members of the Capital Markets team and conducted a content priortization exercise with them. </p>

      <p class="case-cnt-right">After conducting the research above, our team had a clearly defined direction, and felt confident in our ability to begin the design process. By analyzing all of the data collected above, and comparing the needs of the business with the needs of users, we began the site mapping process and sought to produce a heavily consolidated version of the existing Capital Markets website. </p>

        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
        <p>Upon successfully completing the site map for the Capital Markets website, our team began to focus on the individual pages and sought to produce the most efficient design solutions possible.</p>
        <p>Using
          <b>Axure</b> as our wireframing tool, we began producing high fidelty wireframes for each page, along with detailed annotations for the development team, which clearly illustrated the various states of each page. Below are examples of the final wireframes produced and shared with the UI & Development teams.</p>

      <p>The Bank of Montreal Capital Markets re-design was my first professional experience within a UX design team. Throughout the duration of my internship, I was exposed to a variety of new UX practices, and was able to gain detailed insight as to how one of Canadaâ€™s largest banks operates within the digital field.
      </p>

      <p>Being apart of the UX design team allowed me to learn from an industry leader and actively contribute to a successful project conducted by the BMO Financial Group.</p>
